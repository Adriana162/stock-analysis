# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to see if we can make a VBA script run faster by refactoring code.
Steve has graduated with a finance degree, and his parents would like to invest in green energy as his first clients.
A script was made to analyze an entire dataset of stocks in order to help Steve do research for his parents. Steve wants to
expand the dataset to include the entire stock market from the last few years, so the objective is to refactor this script to work 
with thousands of stocks and make it execute in a short amount of time. 

## Results

The execution time for the year 2017 is 0.109375 seconds.

The execution time for the year 2018 is 0.1328125 seconds.

For the original scripts, the execution time for 2017 is 0.4960938 seconds, and 0.484375 seconds for 2018. 

## Summary
Looking at the results, the performance of the code ran in less seconds with the refactored code. This is one the pros with code 
refactoring, it can give faster results and improvements. A con with code refactoring is, there is a possibility of making errors
so it will bring in bugs to the code.
